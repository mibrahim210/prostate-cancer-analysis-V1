This repository contains all the code used to explore and understand the problem described in our TRPMS 2026 submission. The notebooks are designed to first introduce the problem and then guide the reader through the intuition behind the proposed framework presented in the paper.All of our notebooks include detailed comments that clearly explain each cell.Each experiment follows the same preprocessing steps. Although this introduces some redundancy, it ensures that each notebook can be run independently.

## Understanding Co-variate Shift with visualization
- The notebook 1_RENNES_PROSTATE_CANCER_COVARIATE_VISUALIZATION.ipynb provides an in-depth explanation of covariate shift supported by appropriate visualizations.  
- The notebook covariate_shift.ipynb builds on this work by applying machine learning algorithms to demonstrate how we addressed the covariate shift.
